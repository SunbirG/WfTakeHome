I have tried my best to do all that was asked.

Problems that I had:

I didnt understand the question on ui states for buttons on the modal. I made them green like the screenshots but I have a feeling that it was just the actual look of when a button is hovered etc. make it look like that.

The progress bar was had to complet I could not get the bar to move.
